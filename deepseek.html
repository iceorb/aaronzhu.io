                <span class="disclaimer">*The following does not represent any political leanings within American
                    politics or Chinese vs. American politics, and merely states observations and experiences
                    had.*</span>

                <p>
                    With the release of DeepSeek R1 and renewed calls to ban TikTok and ByteDance in the U.S., it’s
                    clear that geopolitical tensions are not just shaping but actively weaponizing the global technology
                    landscape. DeepSeek didn't just match American capabilities; they did it with a fraction of the
                    compute and budget. This exposes the uncomfortable truth: American tech has become bloated,
                    inefficient, and expensive. We are throwing billions at problems that leaner, hungrier competitors
                    are solving with millions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It’s easy to frame this as a straightforward political rivalry—one that conveniently serves those in
                    power. DeepSeek, an emerging AI threat. ByteDance, a national security risk. Chinese AI vs. American
                    AI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But as I witness this happen from the US and China, I feel that the reality is far more unsettling:
                    <strong>America isn’t being outmaneuvered by foreign adversaries—it’s sabotaging itself.</strong>
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>America is consolidating.</h3>
                        <p>Decades of consolidations, mergers, and acquisitions have hollowed out both traditional tech
                            and defense. When was the last time Apple shipped a groundbreaking product? How has Boeing
                            consistently failed time and again to create reliable aircraft? Why are only five major
                            defense companies left in the U.S? We let this happen—driven by greed, complacency, and an
                            aversion to risk.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>The real drivers of innovation aren’t American.</h3>
                        <p>They’re outsiders, visa holders, immigrants—those drawn to the U.S. by its research
                            institutions and economic opportunities. But that doesn’t mean American-born talent is at
                            the forefront. We need not just engineers, but talent in every job from all countries in the
                            world. The scapegoat narrative to remove immigrants at almost every socioeconomic rung seems
                            an ill-fated political distraction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>American “Protectionism” (Greed)</h3>
                        <p>The push to ban TikTok is less about national security and more about market allocation. When
                            politicians act as kingmakers—deciding which apps stay and which go, benefiting domestic
                            donors like Oracle—they aren't protecting the American public; they are insulating American
                            companies from the very competition that forces them to innovate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Social Immobility:</strong> America has only been around less than 300 years. As
                            society continues to evolve, castes harden, not helped by any self-serving politician. Those
                            who attend the Ivy League go on to land prestigious jobs and maintain a good network, those
                            who don’t are worse off. These cycles repeat, repeat, and harden.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Economic stagnation, social immobility, and the hoarding of wealth are exactly what turned Europe
                    into a museum for the world—preserving the past rather than building the future. Once the global
                    leader in science, industry, and exploration, Europe now has little to show in the way of
                    groundbreaking innovation. It maintains prestige, but not progress. Europe never ran out of talent,
                    it ran out of nerve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't just see this as a detached observer; I see it as the child of people who risked everything
                    for the promise of the American edge. My parents came here a year before the Tiananmen Square
                    protests— to seek refuge and opportunity. I grew up believing in the American Dream—the idea that
                    innovation, hard work, and merit can propel anyone forward. But belief alone doesn’t build the
                    future. People have to come and do the work, and see themselves to be rewarded. That belief needs to
                    be based on reality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Cold War didn’t just provide an enemy. It provided a mirror. A mirror which we were able to look
                    ourselves in the eye and ask if we were good enough. Today, we’re smashing the mirror instead of
                    engaging in competition. We don’t need the paranoia of Warhawks and anti-immigrant sentiment. We
                    just need the hunger of the underdog— the same hunger that brought my parents here, and the only
                    thing that keeps American dynamism alive.
